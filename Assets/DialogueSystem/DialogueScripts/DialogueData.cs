public string[] animationTarget; // will be coupled into the animation class. Defines whether or not and what an animation is targeted at. For example, a point animation will be targeted at some specific object/direction

public string[] movementPath; // will be coupled into the animation class. Defines whether the object doing the animation is moving positions while doing it. usually reserved for walking/running animations, but could have other use cases. Simply defines a location to move to, and a speed at which it is done.


public string[] expression; // may or may not be coupled into the animation class. Defines the expression the gameobject has on dialgoue trigger

//all animation based things can either be specifically defined, default, or not defined. If not defined, the object will simply keep the same settings as the previous setting.
//If defined, the animations will execute based on the order numbers defined in the animation class. For example, all animations with order #1 will execute simultaneously, then everything with 2 and so on.
// If default, the object will revert to its default position. Every object will have a resting/default animation.
